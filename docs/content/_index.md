# Abstract

Elasticsearch is a distributed full-text search engine built on Lucene. This library creates a Mongo DB like 
interface so Elasticsearch may be used as a standalone database for small web applications.

Note the DBMS and this library are both called 'elasticsearch'.

### Provides

* A transparent protocol for interacting with the Elasticsearch REST API
* Interfaces based on the the mgo library for Mongo DB.
* Solid test harness for future extensibility
* Roadmap for Bulk API and deep querying support
